### STRUCTURE-ORIENTED SMOOTHING

The "Real_Seismic_ST.ipynb" file contains the code for structure-oriented smoothing. The data file is 'lineA.sgy': a segy formatted file

### Deep Learning based denoising 

1.Simple autoencoder code: "Simple_autoencoder_large(1).ipynb"

2.UNet-based autoencoder code: "unet_autoencoder(copy)(1).ipynb" & "unet_autoencoder(copy)_wth_real_data.ipynb"
A synthetic dataset was used for training,testing and validation for these models. Because of its large size, it cannot be uploaded here.
